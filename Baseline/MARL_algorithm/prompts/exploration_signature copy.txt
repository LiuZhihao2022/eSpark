    # Here are some tips you should note when you generate your response
    # 1.The backlog_ratio and overflow_cost_ratio are fixed variables. They have nothing to do with the creation of backlog_cost and excess_cost, and only serve as weights.
    # 2.backlog_cost is because the current inventory cannot meet the current downstream demand. A low inventory is probable to incur high backlog_cost
    # 3.excess_cost is because the current inventory plus the SKUs arriving today exceed the capacity of the warehouse. A high sum of inventory of all SKUs is probable to incur excess_cost
    # 4.capacity is shared among a warehouse, so it's meanless to compare capacity with the inventory of a single sku
    # 5.your replenishment order will arrive after vlt days. So your replenishment action today will not affect your inventory today
    # 6.You need to maintain as healthy an inventory as possible to meet downstream demand, but don't keep an inventory so large that it creates excess_cost
