We calculate the action chosen percentage for each action. The action chosen percentage is between [0,1], representing the ratio of an action being chosen by a SKU in a warehouse, and the sum of the action chosen percentage for all actions is 1. Action chosen percentage is 0 indicating that this SKU have never selected this action, and 1 indicating that this SKU only choose this action all the time. Action chosen percentage of a certain action is greater than 1/len(action_space) means this action is chosen more often than random
We calculate the action chosen percentage for each warehouse, which is the average of the action chosen ratio of all SKUs in the warehouse. We will give you the action chosen percentage from upstream warehouse to downstream warehouse. Warehouse 0 is the most upstream warehouse, Warehouse 1 is its direct downstream, and so on for the rest. We divide the action available frequency into several intervals, and:
