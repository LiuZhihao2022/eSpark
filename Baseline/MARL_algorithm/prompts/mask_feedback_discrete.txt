We record the action available frequency of the exploration policy and its components for each SKU during the training process. Action available frequency means the frequency that actions is not masked. The action available frequency is between [0,1]. Action available frequency is 0 indicating that the action has never been available for a SKU, and 1 indicating that the action is available for this SKU all the time.

We calculate the action available frequency for each warehouse, which is the average of the action available frequency of all SKUs in the warehouse. We will give you the action available frequency from upstream warehouse to downstream warehouse. Warehouse 0 is the most upstream warehouse, Warehouse 1 is its direct downstream, and so on for the rest. We divide the action available frequency into several intervals, and:
