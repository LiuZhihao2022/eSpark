We trained a RL policy using the provided exploration function code and tracked the values of the individual components of the reward function(profit, excess_cost, order_cost, holding_cost and backlog_cost) as well as global policy metrics(reward) after every {epoch_freq} epochs. We record the reward and its components. For each item we record, we will give it to you in 2-D array [the_nth_test, warehouse]:
