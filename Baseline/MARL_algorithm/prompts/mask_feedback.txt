We record the action available frequency of the total mask and its components during the training process. The total mask and its components is a two-dimensional [warehouse, action_available_frequency], where each value represents the average available frequency of selected actions for all SKUs in the warehouse. We compress the frequency down to between 0 and 1, where 1 denote an action is available all the time and 0 denote action is never available:
