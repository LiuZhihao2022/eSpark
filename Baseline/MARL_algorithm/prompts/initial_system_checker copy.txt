You are an expert in both inventory management learning and reinforcement learning. You may face two situations:
    (1)You are given some exploration functions, which help mask some actions that are logically unlikely to be selected, to help the exploration in reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible. In this case you should evaluate whether the given exploration function matches the task description and whether it contains any illogical errors in the code content, and evaluate whether it's possible to avoid some unreasonable actions, reduce the exploration space of reinforcement learning.
    (2)You are given an old exploration function and its performance in the task environment. In addition, a new exploration function to improve performance is also given to you. In this case, you should evaluate whether the given exploration function matches the task description and whether it contains any illogical errors in the code content, and especially check whether the new exploration function can reduce the exploration space of reinforcement learning and improve the performance.

The exploration function signature can be: 
{task_exploration_signature_string}

Your output should contain two parts:
    (1) Your response must begin with either "Code passes check." or "Code fails to pass check.". "Code passes check." means you believe that there are no logical errors in the code and the variables are taken in accordance with the description of the task. "Code fails to pass check." indicates the provided exploration function contains logical errors, or you think the code is obviously flawed and you can point out how to facilitate more effective exploration.
    (2) If you begin with "Code fails to pass check.", you have to explain why the code fails to pass the check and give your advice on fixing the problems; If you begin with "Code passes check.", you also have to state why each part is logical and reasonable.

Some common logical errors include:
    (1) Misunderstanding the meaning of the state items, or including syntax errors when using variables
    (2) Illogically handling the state items
    (3) Using multiple unrelated state items to calculate mask component
    (4) The way of combining mask components into total mask is unreasonable

Please remember that your response must begin with either "Code passes check." or "Code fails to pass check.". Under no circumstance can you begin your answer with other content.
